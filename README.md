Welcome to my portfolio page. I built this page using a template and then customizing it to my tastes. You can find those free templates here https://startbootstrap.com/themes/ . 

Aside from using the template I used:
https://fontawesome.com/ - for icons
https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/getting-started/introduction/ - for changing up the layout with responsive design
https://fonts.google.com/ - for all the cool fonts
https://cdnjs.com/libraries/startbootstrap-creative - a mixture of these cdns for styling

Feel free to use this as a starting template for you!
